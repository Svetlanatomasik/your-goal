# your-goal

This is applications where I
trying different techniques
for setting styles dynamically
and for styling components such that other components
are not affected by a specific component's styles.

Styled components is a library,
which allows to set up pre-styled components
with their own scoped styles.

CSS Modules is a feature which is only available
in projects that are configured to support it
because it needs a code transformation that needs to
be done before your code runs in the browser.
The react projects created
with create react app 
are already configured to support CSS Modules.
